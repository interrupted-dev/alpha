    "# You're absolutely right, in your specific example, all three approaches (apply, applymap, and map) produce the same output\n",
    "# . However, there are subtle differences between them that are important to understand when working with DataFrames in Pandas. \n",
    "# Here's a breakdown of each method:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. apply\n",
    "\n",
    "# Purpose: Applies a function element-wise to each column (or row) of a DataFrame. \n",
    "# It's designed for more complex operations that can potentially modify or return new data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "# func: The function to be applied (can be a custom function, lambda function, or a method name).\n",
    "# Optional: axis: Determines whether the function is applied to rows (axis=0, default) or columns (axis=1).\n",
    "# Returns: A Series or DataFrame depending on the applied function and axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python\n",
    "# def square(x):\n",
    "#     return x**2\n",
    "\n",
    "# df1.apply(square, axis=1)  # Apply to each column\n",
    "# Use code with caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. applymap\n",
    "\n",
    "# Purpose: Applies a function element-wise to each value within the DataFrame. \n",
    "# It's intended for simple operations that don't require modifying the data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "# func: The function to be applied (similar to apply).\n",
    "# Returns: A new DataFrame with the same structure, where each value has been modified by the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python\n",
    "# df1.applymap(lambda x: x**2)  # Element-wise squaring\n",
    "# Use code with caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. map (deprecated in Pandas 1.1.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Purpose: Similar to applymap, applies a function element-wise to each value. \n",
    "# However, it's deprecated in newer Pandas versions (use applymap instead).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "# func: The function to be applied.\n",
    "# Returns: A new DataFrame with the same structure as the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "# When to Use Which:\n",
    "\n",
    "# apply: Use this for complex operations that involve modifying data structures or returning new structures.\n",
    "# applymap: Use this for simple element-wise operations that don't change the DataFrame's structure. (Recommended over map.)\n",
    "# map: Avoid using map as it's deprecated in newer Pandas versions. Use applymap instead.\n",
    "# In your example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Since you're squaring each value (a simple operation), all three methods produce the same output.\n",
    "# However, for more complex operations, the differences become more apparent.\n",
    "# Remember, choosing the appropriate method depends on the complexity of your operations\n",
    "# and how you want to manipulate the DataFrame's data structure."
